# PartForge — Business Plan

## The Opportunity
There is NO dedicated marketplace for 3D printable car parts. Automotive 3D printing is a fast-growing niche scattered across general platforms (Cults3D, Thingiverse, CGTrader). Nobody owns this vertical yet.

The 3D printing market is projected at $50B+ by 2030. Automotive aftermarket is $500B+. The intersection — custom 3D printed car parts — is completely underserved.

## Revenue Model

### Primary: $5 Flat Listing Fee
- Sellers pay $5 to list a part (one-time, not recurring)
- No commission on sales — sellers keep 100%
- This is the key differentiator: other platforms take 20-30% commission
- Sellers are incentivized to list here because they make MORE money
- Payment via Stripe (handles all card processing)
- Stripe fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction → you net ~$4.55 per listing

### Secondary: Pro Seller Tier ($10/month)
- Featured placement in search results
- Analytics dashboard (views, clicks, conversion)
- Unlimited listings (vs 10/month on free)
- Verified seller badge
- Priority support

### Tertiary: Boost/Promote ($3 per boost)
- Push any listing to top of search for 7 days
- Impulse buy for sellers who want more visibility

### Future: Managed Sales (5% commission)
- Optional: PartForge handles the full transaction (payment + file delivery)
- Sellers who don't want to deal with their own Gumroad/PayPal can opt in
- 5% commission (much lower than Cults3D's 20% or CGTrader's 30%)

## Competitive Advantage

1. **First mover** — Nobody else is doing "car parts only" for 3D printing
2. **No commission** — Sellers make more money here than anywhere else
3. **Car-specific search** — Search by Make → Model → Year → Part type. No other platform does this well.
4. **Community** — Car enthusiasts + 3D printing enthusiasts overlap heavily. Build the community, own the niche.
5. **Your YouTube channel** — Built-in marketing machine. One video = thousands of potential users.
6. **You're a real user** — You actually design and print car parts. You understand the market because you ARE the market.

## Marketing Strategy (All Free)

1. **YouTube video**: "I Built a Marketplace for 3D Printed Car Parts" → this IS the launch
2. **Reddit**: Post on r/3Dprinting, r/functionalprint, r/cars, r/Mercedes, r/BMW, r/projectcar
3. **Car forums**: Mercedes-Benz Forum, Bimmerpost, Club4AG, MX-5 Miata Forum
4. **Facebook groups**: Mercedes 190E groups, 3D printing groups, car mod groups
5. **TikTok/Instagram**: Short clips of 3D printed parts being installed on cars
6. **Cross-promote**: Every part you design gets listed on PartForge → link from YouTube description

## Target Users

### Sellers:
- Car enthusiasts who 3D print custom parts for their own cars
- Professional automotive 3D designers
- Small auto shops that have started using 3D printers
- People who design replacement parts for discontinued vehicles (HUGE market for classic cars)

### Buyers:
- Car owners who have a 3D printer but don't know CAD
- People looking for discontinued/unavailable parts
- Tuners and modders who want unique custom parts
- Auto shops that want to offer 3D printed solutions

- PartForge is a marketplace (like Etsy) — sellers are responsible for their own designs
- Terms of Service should state: no copyrighted/trademarked designs, no safety-critical parts (brake components, structural parts) without disclaimers
- Sellers retain ownership of their designs
- Standard DMCA takedown process for IP disputes
- $5 listing fee is non-refundable (stated in Terms)
