        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to ForgAuto. By using our website and services, you agree to these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using ForgAuto, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To use certain features, you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate and complete information</li>
            <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials</li>
            <li>Accept responsibility for all activities under your account</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Marketplace Rules</h2>
        <p>As a seller, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only sell 3D files you have the right to distribute</li>
            <li>Provide accurate descriptions of your products</li>
            <li>Respond to buyer inquiries in a timely manner</li>
            <li>Pay the required listing fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a buyer, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use purchased files only for personal, non-commercial use unless otherwise specified</li>
            <li>Not redistribute purchased files</li>
            <li>Provide honest reviews and feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Fees and Payments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Listing Fee:</strong> $10 one-time fee per listing</li>
            <li><strong>Commission:</strong> 0% — sellers keep 100% of sales</li>
            <li>All fees are non-refundable unless required by law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Seller Payouts</h2>
        <p>To receive payouts from sales, sellers must complete Stripe Connect onboarding <strong>before</strong> making sales:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sellers must connect a valid Stripe account with full identity verification</li>
            <li>Stripe Connect enables direct payouts to your bank account</li>
            <li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Sales made <strong>before</strong> completing Stripe Connect are retained by ForgAuto as a platform service fee</li>
            <li>Only sales made <strong>after</strong> completing Stripe Connect will be paid to the seller</li>
            <li>This is not a "holding" of funds — ForgAuto keeps all revenue from sales where the seller had not completed payout setup at the time of sale</li>
            <li>Sellers are strongly encouraged to complete Stripe Connect immediately after creating their account to ensure they receive all future earnings</li>
            <li>By listing products without completing Stripe Connect, you acknowledge and agree that ForgAuto retains 100% of those sales</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To receive payouts:</strong> Go to Dashboard → Click "Connect Stripe" → Complete verification. Only then will you receive payment for your sales.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of content you upload. By uploading, you grant ForgAuto a license to display, distribute, and promote your content on our platform.</p>
        <p>You must not upload content that infringes on others' intellectual property rights.</p>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Content</h2>
        <p>You may not upload or sell:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content that infringes copyrights, trademarks, or patents</li>
            <li>Illegal items or content</li>
            <li>Weapons or weapon components</li>
            <li>Misleading or fraudulent content</li>
            <li>Content that violates any applicable laws</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <li>Loss of data or profits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>

        <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
